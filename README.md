# jsDAV

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikedeboer/jsdav.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikedeboer/jsdav)

jsDAV allows you to easily add WebDAV support to a NodeJS application.
jsDAV is meant to cover the entire standard, and attempts to allow integration using an easy to understand API.

## SabreDAV
jsDAV started as a port of [SabreDAV] to NodeJS Javascript, written by Evert Pot
and maintained by Evert and contributors.
[SabreDAV] is regarded as one of the highest quality WebDAV implementations around
and is written entirely in PHP and is the most feature complete implementation
that I've seen to date. I am watching the [SabreDAV] repository closely for changes,
improvements and bugfixes, to see if they can be ported to jsDAV.

## Features

 * Fully WebDAV compliant
 * Supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS/X, DavFSv2, Cadaver, Netdrive, Open Office, and probably more
 * Supporting class 1, 2 and 3 Webdav servers
 * Custom property support
 * Locking support
 * Pass all Litmus tests

## Features in development

 * CalDAV (to be tested with Evolution, iCal, iPhone and Lightning).

## Supported RFC's

 * [RFC2617]: Basic/Digest auth
 * [RFC2518]: First WebDAV spec
 * [RFC4709]: [DavMount]
 * [RFC5397]: current-user-principal

## Testing

In order to run the test suite locally, you can run `npm test`. In addition to the mocha suite, there are also "smoke tests" which can be run manually in `test/smoke`.
